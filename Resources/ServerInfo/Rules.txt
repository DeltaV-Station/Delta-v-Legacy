[color=#ff0000]You must be 17 or older to play. Users under 17 will be banned immediately.[/color]

[color=#ff0000]Delta-V is a Medium Roleplay server. Try to immerse yourself into your character. This includes doing your job and delegating tasks that are outside of that description. This is not to imply you just work all round; almost every job has more downtime than not. There's a wide variety of jobs that are completely downtime.[/color]

[color=#a4885c]0.[/color] Admins can disregard any and all of these rules if they deem it in the best interest of the current round, server, and/or community at large.
    - They will of course be held fully accountable for their actions if they exercise this privilege.

[color=#a4885c]0.1.[/color] All of these rules apply as they are intended.
    - Every example of a rule break cannot be defined as written, therefore, enforcement of the rules is subject to staff interpretation of the rule's intention.

[color=#a4885c]1.[/color] Erotic Roleplay (ERP), erotic content, or 18+ sexual content is [color=#ff0000]not allowed under any circumstance[/color].

[color=#a4885c]2.[/color] Follow the community expectations. This includes both in game and elsewhere in our community.
    - Don't be a dick.
    - Do not grief as a non-antagonist; this includes against AFK and catatonic players.
    - Don't be racist or bigoted.
    - Do not cheat or abuse glitches; please report all bugs on Discord.
    - Do not evade bans.

[color=#a4885c]3.[/color] Do not use information gained outside of in-character means, and do not say In Character (IC) things in the Local Out Of Character (LOOC) chat channel.
    - I.e. metagaming. This especially refers to communication between players outside of the game via things like Discord, known as meta-comms. Characters are otherwise allowed to know everything about in-game mechanics or antagonists, as well as keep persistent friendships and relationships with other characters when not for the purpose of unfair advantage by teaming up together for little IC reason.
    - Do not say LOOC things in IC either.

[color=#a4885c]4.[/color] After cloning, metempsychosis or taking a ghost role, you forget your previous life.
    - If cloned, you don't have amnesia, but you do forget the last five minutes leading to your death and cannot describe who or what killed you.
    - Don't act on anything you saw while ghosted.


[color=#a4885c]5.[/color] Security and command roles are held to a higher standard and must follow space law.
    - If you don’t have time to play a full round, do not select these roles.
    - If you need to leave your computer, send an ahelp and notify your fellow crew via the radio.

[color=#a4885c]6.[/color] Follow Chat Guidelines
    - Only speak in English.
    - Do not spam.
    - Do not advertise.
    - Do not use netspeak in character (i.e. LOL, ROFL).
    - Hate speech, slurs and bigotry are [color=#ff0000]not allowed[/color]. Words that are closely tied to real life slurs are [color=#ff0000]not allowed[/color].
    - No Simulated Racism, While you don’t have to like everybody, you should not be acting upon your distaste for other races/morphotypes.

[color=#a4885c]7.[/color] All constructed/summoned beings are bound by their laws and must abide by these laws.
    - If a being has a master, they must follow their master's orders.
    - Your master is held accountable if they order you to do something malicious.

[color=#a4885c]8.[/color] Follow Roleplay Guidelines
    - Your IC name must be realistic. Avoid joke names and names of fictional or real people, or names playing off of them (e.g. Saul Badman.) Theatrical Roles like clown, boxer, and mime are allowed stage names.
    - Treat your character as a separate entity from you, the player. Your character's actions, feelings, and knowledge in-game should be based solely on the character's experiences and not your own as the player. Low roleplay actions that have no regard for your character or the setting (Memes, silly copy paste spam IC) are not acceptable.
    - Character development can occur over rounds but each round is a soft-reset, meaning you can have previous shift experience but your character will never have died in the past.
    - Command and Security will be held to a higher standard for roleplay.
    - By picking prisoner, you have chosen to RP as a prisoner.  While escape is allowed, there are consequences for your actions.

[color=#a4885c]9.[/color] Follow Escalation Guidelines
    - Do not escalate situations needlessly. Very few things are deserving of a fight to the death.
    - Antagonistic ghost roles, and pest ghost roles like mice are always fair game for attacking. Don't grief crew-aligned ghost roles like familiars, drones, or pets without provocation.
    - If a fight results in someone being critically injured, seek medical help for them.

[color=#a4885c]10.[/color] Follow Antagonist Guidelines
    - The damage antagonists cause should be roughly proportional to their objectives, and contribute towards achieving them in some way. However antagonists have leniency in regards to what they can and can’t do.  If you are concerned as to whether or not what you're about to do is allowed, feel free to ahelp and ask an admin.
    - Other antagonists are not necessarily your friends. Traitors, rat kings, and possibly even space dragons are free agents, but no one should be working together with xenomorphs, nuclear operatives, or zombies.
    - Exploits, arrivals camping, and other extremely lame behavior are forbidden.
