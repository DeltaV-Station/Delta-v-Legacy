## Starting Out
This is an extensive list of recipes. How to source them, however, is left as an exercise to the reader.

Mixes are done in a Beaker, foods are cooked in a Microwave. 

Cook times and number of ingredients are also left for the reader to determine. 

This is an automatically generated list. If something in the list looks awkward, please persevere.
